  - [x] âœ¨ NEW: Created automated demo system - each demo is just a JS file and HTML is auto-generated
  - [x] âœ¨ NEW: Demo source code is displayed alongside the running demo to ensure accuracy
  - [x] âœ¨ NEW: Demos are generated from `demo-scripts/` directory with metadata in JSDoc comments
  - [x] âœ¨ NEW: Hot reloading development environment with Vite plugin
